# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

- **Project deadlines**: We have a fixed deadline for completing the project,

  complexity of the features we can implement and the time required to complete
  them.
- **Time available to work on the project**: Our team's availability and work
  schedules impact the amount of time we have to work on the project. So,
  availability of each member was disscused during of communication planning.

## Internal: Voluntary

- **Coding style and conventions**: Our team decide to follow a specific coding
  style and set of conventions to ensure consistency and maintainability in the
  codebase.
- **Code review checklist**: We create a checklist for code reviews to ensure
  that each piece of code meets certain standards and guidelines.
- **Hours spent working**: We decided to work for a specific number of hours
